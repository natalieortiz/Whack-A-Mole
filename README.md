# Whack-a-Weenie


This is a whack-a-mole style game that I created using Javascript and JQuery.  The player hits the Start Game button and a timer and the game starts.  The player has 30 seconds to click on as many weenie dogs as possible.  When a square is active, a dog pops up, that's when the user can click on it for points. 

There is also a score box to show the user their score.  If the user gets a high score, they get to see a YouTube embedded video that is presented in a Twitter Bootstrap modal that pops up.
